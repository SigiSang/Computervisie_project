abstract = {This paper presents a theoretically very simple yet efficient multiresolution approach to gray scale and rotation invariant texture classification based on local binary pat- terns and nonparametric discrimination of sample and prototype distributions. The method is based on recognizing that certain local binary patterns termed ‘uniform' are fundamental prop- erties of local image texture, and their occurrence histogram proves to be a very powerful tex- ture feature. We derive a generalized gray scale and rotation invariant operator presentation that allows for detecting the ‘uniform' patterns for any quantization of the angular space and for any spatial resolution, and present a method for combining multiple operators for multires- olution analysis. The proposed approach is very robust in terms of gray scale variations, since the operator is by definition invariant against any monotonic transformation of the gray scale. Another advantage is computational simplicity, as the operator can be realized with a few oper- ations in a small neighborhood and a lookup table. Excellent experimental results obtained in true problems of rotation invariance, where the classifier is trained at one particular rotation angle and tested with samples from other rotation angles, demonstrate that good discrimination can be achieved with the occurrence statistics of simple rotation invariant local binary patterns. These operators characterize the spatial configuration of local image texture and the perfor- mance can be further improved by combining them with rotation invariant variance measures that characterize the contrast of local image texture. The joint distributions of these orthogonal measures are shown to be very powerful tools for rotation invariant texture analysis.},

@article{Ojala1996,
abstract = {Nowadays, quality control is an important problem for fabric manufacturers. Typically these operations have been carried out by humans operators. However, this method has numerous drawbacks such as low precision, performance and effectiveness. Therefore, automatic inspection systems have increased substantially in the last decade. This work evaluates the performance of some texture measures in textile defect detection applications. For classification a method based on leaving-one-out is used. Our study has been carried out using a large database of samples to take into account a wide spectrum of fabrics and multiple defects of different nature reported by specialized works and publications. A ranking with the effectiveness of best algorithms is presented for every type of fabric. In addition, the computation time of the algorithms is compared},
